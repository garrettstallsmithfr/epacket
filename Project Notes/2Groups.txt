Why we do not want to pursue the Chatbot:
- Outside of our skillset
	* We only have two months to work on this and none of us have worked with a chat bot before
	* Most of that time would be spent learning the correct approach, not making a quality product

- Complex
	* The chatbot must be able to handle all text thrown at it
	* As quality increases complexity increases
	* Predictive text is too expensive, rule based is too hard to create in two months

- The landing page is within grasp
	* We have the technical skillset
	* We believe we can deliver a quality produce in two months


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Goal with Landing Page:
- Create a tool to help automate a part of the call center's job.

- Drivers scan a qr code sticker and are brought to webpage in their browser
- They are given a form to fill in information about their crash

- In theory, this works as a tool for the call center to do screening faster
	* If somebody uses the tool, the call center could reduce time asking simple questions


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notes:

- JSONify query. Load a bunch of variable into a string and then parse that string to only use one query
- Use buzzwords to break their brains
- Push driver to send information
- Don't want to atuomatically create a claim
- Push driver to mobile app
- Click to call
- Return on investment for stickers versus packet printing

- No claim creation
